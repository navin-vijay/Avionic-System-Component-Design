<img width="1486" height="717" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-07 000723" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/807aa453-7b7b-41ae-a909-5c5edfc0ca66" />


## Project Overview
This repository contains the design files for an **Avionic System Component**, a lightweight bracket modeled in **Siemens NX 12** for aerospace applications. The design features triangular cutouts for weight reduction (approximately 30-40%) while ensuring structural integrity, with precise mounting holes and fillets for stress relief. This project serves as a skill-building exercise focusing on CAD/CAM precision and manufacturability.

### Key Design Features
- **Dimensions**: 124.9 mm (L) x 75.7 mm (W) x 10 mm (H), all in mm.
- **Weight Optimization**: Triangular cutouts reduce mass effectively.
- **Mounting**: Four Ã˜11.6 mm holes for secure fastening.
- **Fillets**: R3 and R6 for stress concentration mitigation.

## Tools and Software Used
- **Primary**: Siemens NX 12 for 3D modeling and 2D drafting.
- **Skills Applied**: Extrusion, patterning, boolean operations, filleting, and GD&T.

## Next Steps
- Perform FEA analysis for load testing.
- Generate CAM toolpaths for CNC machining.
- Explore topology optimization for further weight reduction.
